# EIP-Course

This repository contains example source-code for a 32-hour course on Enterprise Integration Patterns. 
It includes mostly simple JMS examples that demonstrate the concepts of most of the 65 patterns. 
There are also small snippets of code with examples in Camel and Spring Integration which are will be added as full working examples (but only some of these are avaliable now).
The course text material (not in this repository) is in Portuguese.
